# Package administration (sudo)

A container is generally meant to be immutable, but occasionally it can
be useful to add/update some packages, which is usually done via 'sudo'
to gain the necessary permissions.

However, since host UID/GID values are mappped in with libnss_wrapper
(which is ignored for 'sudo') we need an additional administration
user for this purpose:  User=sudofoam  passwd=foam


This "double-hop" then looks like this:

    openfoam$ su - sudofoam
    sudofoam$ sudo apt-get update
    sudofoam$ sudo apt-get install ...


Not as comfortable as we would like, but it is used infrequently.
